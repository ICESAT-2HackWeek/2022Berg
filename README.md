# Berg: "Harmonization of SAR and Laser Altimetry: Ship and Iceberg Detection"			

ICESat-2 presents unique capabilities in measuring iceberg heights, something that cannot be done accurately with SAR imagery alone. As icebergs present issues for ships, laser altimetry provides a way to assess the potential risks in navigating through or around icebergs. SAR imagery has been applied to detect both icebergs and ships but distinguishing the features has proved difficult. Using ICESat-2, height measurements of objects could allow maritime observers to both distinguish these features and assess risks associated with icebergs.
